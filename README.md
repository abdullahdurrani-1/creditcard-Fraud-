# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Supervised Learning



## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning algorithms, particularly **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**. The dataset is highly imbalanced, which poses a challenge and requires proper preprocessing and evaluation strategies.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

- **Source**: Kaggle ([Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud))
- **Size**: 284,807 transactions
- **Target**: `Class` (1 = Fraud, 0 = Non-Fraud)
- **Features**: 30 anonymized numerical features + `Time`, `Amount`

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Pipeline

### 🔹 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Applied **StandardScaler** to `Amount` and `Time`
- Dropped scaled columns after transformation
- Checked for nulls and unique values

### 🔹 2. **Train-Test Split**
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.2)
````

### 🔹 3. **Modeling**

* **Logistic Regression** as a baseline
* **Random Forest Classifier** (with `class_weight='balanced'`) to handle class imbalance

### 🔹 4. **Evaluation Metrics**

* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, F1 Score
* **ROC Curve & AUC**
* Feature Importance Plot

### 🔹 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

```python
GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, scoring='f1', cv=3)
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

* Proper preprocessing and scaling improves model reliability.
* Class imbalance requires **class weights** or **resampling**.
* ROC & F1-Score are more meaningful than accuracy for imbalanced datasets.
* Feature importance gives insight into what drives fraud detection.

## 📚 Future Improvements

* Use SMOTE or ADASYN for synthetic oversampling
* Try other models: XGBoost, LightGBM
* Deploy with Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions
